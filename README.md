## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Access Issues
- Ensure your browser has permission to access the microphone
- Try refreshing the page and allowing permissions again

### Python/Model Issues
- Make sure Python is installed and accessible from command line
- Verify that all Python dependencies are installed: `pip list | grep -E "(whisper|transformers)"`
- Check that the Whisper model can be loaded: `python -c "import whisper; whisper.load_model('small')"`
- Check that the translation model can be loaded: `python -c "from transformers import pipeline; pipeline('translation', model='Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-ur-en')"`

### Audio Processing Errors
- Ensure you're speaking clearly in Urdu
- Try shorter recordings (under 30 seconds)
- Check that the audio file format is supported (WAV, MP3, M4A, etc.)

### Performance Notes
- First transcription may take longer as both models load
- The "small" Whisper model provides good balance between speed and accuracy
- Translation model will be downloaded on first use (~200MB)
- For faster processing, you can change to "tiny" Whisper model in `transcribe.py`
- Both models will be cached after first use for faster subsequent processing
